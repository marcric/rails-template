# Rails Template

## Introduction

### This is a fork of the original _[Helabs Rails Template][helabsrt]_

My target with this fork is to have a functional Windows version of the original template.

Basically changing a few gem versions I get the job done.

That is it. _**[MarcRic][mr]**_

## Usage

1. Clone rails-template to a local folder.
2. Open a console in the folder you want your application to be generated into.
3. Use: rails new myApp -m E:\rails-template\template.rb
4. Change the database.yml to fit your needs
5. Use: rake db:create
6. Use: rails s
7. On Your browser: http://localhost:3000/
