# Rails Template

## Introduction

### This is a fork of the original _[Helabs Rails Template][helabsrt]_

My target with this fork is to have a functional Windows version of the original template.

Basically changing a few gem versions I get the job done.

That is it. _**[MarcRic][mr]**_

## Usage

rails new myStart -m E:\AA-StartupDev\rails-template\template.rb
